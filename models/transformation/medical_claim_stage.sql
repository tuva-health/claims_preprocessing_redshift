-- Author       Thu Xuan Vu
-- Created      June 2022
-- Purpose      A copy of the claims input layer with enhancements(terminology, merged claims, and encounter types).  This will power the core layer.
-- Notes        Created this table to allow for validation and as an easier way to pass through claim fields from input layer to output layer.
